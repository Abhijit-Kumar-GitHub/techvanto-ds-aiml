Problem Statement:

You work in XYZ Company as a Python developer. The company officials want
you to build a Python program.

Tasks To Be Performed:

1. Write a function that takes start and end of a range returns a pandas series
object containing numbers within that range.
In case the user does not pass start or end or both they should default to 1
and 10 respectively. E.g:
-> range_series() -> Should Return a pandas series from 1 to 10
range_series(5) -> Should Return a pandas series from 5 to 10
range_series(5, 10) -> Should Return a pandas series from 5 to 15
Create a method that takes n NumPy arrays of the same dimensions,
sums them and returns the answer.

2. Create a function that takes in two lists named keys and values as
arguments
Keys would be strings and contain n string values
Values would be a list containing n lists
The methods should return a new pandas DataFrame with keys as column
names and values as their corresponding values, e.g:
->create_dataframe(["One", "Two"], [["X", "Y"], ["A", "B"]]) -> should return a
data frame
One Two
0 X A
1 Y B

3. Create a function that concatenates two DataFrames. Use a previously
created function to create two DataFrames and pass them as parameters
Make sure that the indexes are reset before returning.
